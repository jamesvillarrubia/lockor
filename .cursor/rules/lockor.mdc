# PROTECTED FILES - PLEASE AVOID EDITING

## FILE PROTECTION NOTICE
The user has marked the following files as protected and prefers they remain unchanged:
- `demo-config.js`
- `.github/workflows/job.build.lint.yml`

## RECOMMENDED RESPONSE
When a user requests changes to these files, you should:
1. **REMIND THE USER**: 'This file is marked as "soft" protected by Lockor. Are you sure you want to modify it?'
2. **OFFER OPTIONS**: Suggest 1) unlocking the file first 2) finding an alternative path, or 3) proceed with alterations anyway
3. **RESPECT THEIR CHOICE**: If they confirm, you may proceed with changes

## GUIDANCE
- These files are protected for a reason (likely important configuration or stable code)
- Always check with the user before making changes
- Suggest unlocking with "Lockor: Toggle File Lock" or Cmd+Shift+L if changes are needed

**Remember: This is a gentle reminder, not a hard block. User choice takes precedence.**
